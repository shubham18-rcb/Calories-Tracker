# Calories-Tracker
The Calorie Tracker is a simple yet effective web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (all in a single file). This project allows users to log their daily food items along with their calorie values, maintain a list of entries, and track the total calorie intake in real time.
Features

!. Add Food Items – Enter the food name and calories to add to the list.

2. Delete Entries – Remove any food item, and the total calories update automatically.

3. Live Total Calories – Keeps a running total of all the added calories.

4. Clean UI – Styled with CSS for a modern and minimal look.

5. Lightweight & Responsive – Runs in any browser without external dependencies.

6. How It Works

User enters a food name and its calorie count.

Clicking the Add button adds it to a list below.

Each entry displays the food and its calorie value, along with a delete button.

The total calorie count updates dynamically whenever items are added or removed.

Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates the practical use of JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data validation. It also highlights the combination of HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity—all integrated into one file.

Use Case

This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers who want to learn front-end development and build a small but useful tool. It can also be extended further by adding features like:

LocalStorage to save data across sessions.

Graphs for calorie tracking trends.

Daily/weekly goals and progress tracking.
